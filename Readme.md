## Overview

This an exercise from the Git and Github Bootcamp course I'm taking through Udemy. The course is instructed by Colt Steele. This is the closing exercise (lesson # 30) from Section 4: Adding and Committing.

### The challenge

This is over the basics of making commits.
The exercise has several steps:

-1: Create a new folder.

-2: Initialize a new git repo inside of the folder.

-3: Make a new file called yard.txt.

-4: Make another new file called groceries.txt.

-5: Make a commit that includes both empty files.

-6: In the yard.txt file, add the following changes: -2 bags of potting soil -1 bag of worm castings

-7: In the groceries.txt file, add the following: - 4 tomatoes - 6 shallots - 1 fennel bulb

-8: Make a new commit, including ONLY the changes from the groceries.txt file. The commit message should be "add ingredients for tomato soup"

### What I learned

- Reading diffs
- View the unstaged changes
- View the Working Directory Changes
- View staged changes
- Diff specific files
- Compare changes across branches
- Compare changes across commits

### Continued development

There are 20 sections to this course, each with a number of lessons and exercises. This is the final exercise from Section 8. There are pervious exercises that I will be posting, as well as exercises that I have done since this one which I will also add. I am more than halfway through this course at this time and not every section has an exercise that could be, or needs to be added to a repository. I will add those exercises that are relevant as it will help solidify my understanding and better develop my skill through practice.
